# Why use a remote computer system?
- Your own computer does not have enough resources to run the desired analysis (memory, processors, disk space, network bandwidth)
- You cannot install software in your computer (application does not have support for your operating system, or conflicts with other existing applications)
- You want to produce results faster than your computer can, for instance by ...
- ... spreading the computational task over several machines running in parallel

# Some terms
- Virtual machine (VM): a software computer running inside another computer (for flexibility and security)
- Operating system (OS): the basic software layer that allows execution and management of applications. Typical examples are Windows, OSX (Mac) and Linux.
- Physical machine: the hardware (processors, memory, disk and network)
- Two kinds of distributed systems:
  - High Performance Computing (HPC): large number of physical machines running the same operating system. Usually jobs, often very many, are queued, and run when it is 'their turn'
  - Cloud Computing: virtual machines, distributed platforms and/or applications offered as a service (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Computing)

- Batch computing: the program runs 'blindly', with all inputs specified beforehand and outputs going to files. Typical of HPC systems
- Interactive execution: the program can be interacted with in real time (e.g. a shell or R session)
- Distributed application: a computer program that can be run simultaneously on several differnt computers (e.g., mpiBLAST)

In the genomics field, both HPC and Cloud Computing usually run Linux because of its performance, flexibility and availability of a large variety of scientific software.

# Differences between HPC and Cloud computing

HPC                                      | Cloud
:--------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------
User account on the system               | administrator account (called 'root') on the system
Limited control of the system            | Full control of the system
Central shared file system               | Local file system
Jobs submitted into a queue              | Jobs executed on each resource
Account-based isolation                  | OS-based isolation
Only Batch execution of applications     | support for batch and interactive applications
Request for resource and time allocation | Pay-per-use
etc.                                     | etc.

For large data sets (e.g. > 100 GB), cloud computing becomes cumbersome due to the need to copy large amounts of data. In that case, a local HPC will be more convenient.
