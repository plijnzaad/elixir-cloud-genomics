# Move data onto your instance

Once you have opened a connection to the remote host you can start your analysis. First of all you need to get the data (being sure you have enough space in your home folder).

## Disk usage and free space

As mentioned in the previous lesson, the `du` and `df` utilities are useful in disk usage analysis. The `du` utility gives informations about the occupied disk space, while the `df` gives informations on the free space on the current disk. Useful options to remember when running the `du` utility are `-h` and `-s`, they makes the output human readable while summarizing. If you need a more detailed output you can run the same command without the `-s` flag and the tool will return a list with the size of all the files in the current folder. To access the size of your home folder you can run:

```bash
$ du -sh
```

The `df` tool, on the other hand, gives you information about the free space on your disk. Again, the `-h` flag makes the output human readable. So, to check how much free space is in your machine just type:

```bash
$ df -h
```

Make sure you have at least 1G of free space in your home folder.

## Download the data

You can download the data as follows:

```
$ cd         # make sure you are in your own home directory
$ wget http://files.figshare.com/2133245/Sample280.fastq.gz
```
In this case, you are using a command line tool, `wget`, to download content from a web server. This command supports downloading files from FTP and HTTP(s).  The tool `wget` also supports recursive download (with the `-r` flag), allowing you to download  complete folders and their contents.  For your information, there are other command line tools that can also be used to download data (e.g., `curl`,`rsync`), but `wget` should serve you well for the current lesson and other bioinformatics analyses. Programs like `wget` can be run 'in the background' (e.g. as a batch job), which is needed for really large transfers.

## Copying files between your local computer and your virtual machine instance

### Graphical user interface for transferring files

There are graphical user interfaces for doing the remote transfers, for instance [WinSCP](http://winscp.net/eng/index.php) or [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/). They can be convenient, but they cannot run as a batch job (while you log out in the mean time). This can be a drawback when transferring really large files.

### Copying files using the command line

You often have transfer files between your local computer and the virtual machine instance. The 'command line way' to do this is to use `scp`, which is very similar to the Unix `cp`. To recall, 

<pre>   
        $ cp <em>file1 [ file2 ... ] destination</em>
</pre>

This copies *file1* (etc) to *destination*. If *destination* is a folder, a new copy of *file1* (etc.) will be created in it. If *destination* is not a folder, *destination* will become a copy of *file1* (and will be overwritten if it already existed).

<pre>   
        $ scp <em>file(s) destination</em>
</pre>


With `scp`, both the <em>file(s)</em> and the <em>destination</em> can be remote. A remote file specification looks like

<pre>
<em>user@hostname:path</em>
</pre>

Here, `user` is your login name at the remote machine. `hostname` is can be something like `login.op.umuctrecht.nl`, but with cloud computing, it more often looks like dotted numbers, e.g. `145.100.50.76`. 
`path` is 'route' to the file or folder, consisting of `/`-separated list of zero or more folders. 
The path is relative to the user's home directory (unless it starts with a `/`, in which case it is 'absolute' path, and starts at the top of the file system).

### Some examples:

#### Copying files from local to the remote (virtual) machine

This process is sometimes called uploading:

```
scp Sample280.fastq.gz jmsith@145.100.50.76:~/mydata.fastq.gz
```

This copies the local file `Sample280_fastq.gz` to user `jmsith`'s home directory (indicated by `~`), at the same time giving it another name, namely `mydata.fastq.gz`. The first time you contact the remote machine, it will show message like this:

```
The authenticity of host '86.50.169.208 (86.50.169.208)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 5e:d6:1e:42:3c:0b:85:b2:34:07:c4:aa:3f:1c:c7:40.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)?
```

Simply type yes and 'Enter'. You will now be asked for a password, and after entering it, the transfer will take place. (Depending on the security set-up, `scp` may have to look a bit different).

Another example:


```
scp Sample280.fastq.gz jmsith@145.100.50.76:~/
```

This is like the previous example, but now the 'path' (namely, `~/`) is just a folder (`~/` means: the users home directory). This means that `Sample280.fastq.gz` will be copied to the virtual machine under its own name.

```
scp Sample280.fastq.gz jmsith@145.100.50.76:~/data/
```

This time, file `Sample280.fastq.gz` will be copied to folder `data`, located inside the users home directory. (This folder must already exist before the copying).

```
scp Sample280.fastq.gz jmsith@145.100.50.76:/data/shared/gen/jsmith/data
```

Here, file `Sample280.fastq.gz` is copied to a different file system, namely `/data/shared/gen/jsmith/data`.

Lastly, it is also possible  to transfer several files in one go, using wildcards:

```
scp Sample*.fastq.gz jmsith@145.100.50.76:~/
```

This will copy all files whose name starts with `Sample` and end in `.fastq.gz` to the remote machinen.


#### Copying files from remotely to locally (AKA downloading)

This is not so different, it's just that the `user@host` part now goes in front of the first file. For instance, once the analysis finished, we want to download the results, e.g.:

```
scp jmsith@145.100.50.76:~/Sample280_fastqc.zip data_fastqc.zip
```

This copies file `Sample280_fastqc.zip` from user `jsmiths`s home directory on virtual machine `145.100.50.76` to a local file called  `data_fastqc.zip` (in the current folder)

If you don't want to repeat the file name for the downloaded version, do it as follows:

```
scp jmsith@145.100.50.76:~/Sample280_fastqc.zip ./
```

Here, `./` means: 'the current directory'.

If you want to download several files, you can again use wild cards:


```
scp jmsith@145.100.50.76:~/Sample*_fastqc.zip ./
```

Downloading from/to using other combinations of hosts, paths and files are of course analogous.
